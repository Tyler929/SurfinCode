### Questions
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

Empowering yourself is actually quite easy, meet new peopele, research code, and generally explore uncharted territory. For exmaple, tri 1 I sought help from computer science experts to assist me in the completion of the logic gates; I was only able to complete te assigment as I empowered myself.

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Reach out to people you might see having trouble in or out of class, having someone to help work through majorly helps in gaining more of an understanding.

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape blocks digital empowerment. Poor families are unable to have the availability of a great selection of digital equipment, compared to the wealthier people who can use anything at their own discretion. At Del Norte we are gifted, we have access to all this computer technology we don’t use, although some lack digital empowerment, putting many at a disadvantage.
