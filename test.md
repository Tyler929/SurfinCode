### Questions
**Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing**

Many organizations exploit the power of computers and use it for destructive purposes including hacking. Although there are "good" hackers out there, often reffered to as "White Hats" the majority lies in "Black Hats" also known as bad hackers. These people solve puzzles and unlock locks providing either a benficial of harmful effect depending on the induviduals intentions.

**Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?**

Yes, I have many struggles with dopamine primarily caused by chronic OCD and temporary depression affecting the balance of serotonin in the brain. This majorly interrupts with my progression as a student and directly interferes with my achievements.

### Questions
**How does someone empower themself in a digital world?**

Empowering yourself is actually quite easy, meet new peopele, research code, and generally explore uncharted territory. For exmaple, tri 1 I sought help from computer science experts to assist me in the completion of the logic gates; I was only able to complete te assigment as I empowered myself.

**How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.**

Reach out to people you might see having trouble in or out of class, having someone to help work through majorly helps in gaining more of an understanding.

**Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?**

Red tape blocks digital empowerment. Poor families are unable to have the availability of a great selection of digital equipment, compared to the wealthier people who can use anything at their own discretion. At Del Norte we are gifted, we have access to all this computer technology we don’t use, although some lack digital empowerment, putting many at a disadvantage.

## **5.3 Questions**

**Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)**

**Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...**

**Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?**

No, HP's intention wasn't to discriminate but to produce an innovative product for users to purchase and use, it is unfourtounte HP was oblivious to this issue. 

**If yes or no, justify you conclusion.**

No, not enough testing was done to determine the widespread diverse use of this product, **unintentionally** being (rascist).

**How do you think this happened?**

Not enough crowdsourcing, HP's testing was very limited based of the results, this meant that no testing was performed on darker skin colors, resulting in complete undetection. 

**Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?**

No, it wasnt intended to be harmful, but helpful, once again it wasnt the creators intention for it to not work correctly. 

**Should it be corrected?**

Yes, of course this is not only a major malfunction on the machines part but the creator's credibility and reliability, as well as it being discriminatory and majorly controversial. 

**What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?**

Ask and test on a wider crowd, more inputs produce better final results which is a scientific fact.

## **5.4 Questions**
**CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

A great way of communicating through our computer science student is not through the class, but theoug general in the COMPSCI Slack server channels. Many find great tools to assist them with code and comptencey. 

**What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

Yes, of course the more ideas, the better final result. More people provide stronger assistance which could help one in their completion of a project. In our PBL website, a great way for us to add PBL's would actually be through crowdsourcing through our fellow Comp Sci students.
